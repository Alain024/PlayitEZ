      <hr>
      <p align="justify"><a name="1" id="1"></a><strong class="subtitle">TYPES OF BETS</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>1.<strong>POINT SPREAD</strong> <br>
        The point spread is the number of  points that the favored team is expected to win by.&nbsp; For example, say the New York Knicks are  favored to beat the LA Clippers by a point spread of 7.&nbsp; That means that if you pick the Knicks to  win, they have to win by more than 7 points for you to win your bet.&nbsp; If they win by fewer than 7 points or lose  the game, you lose your bet.&nbsp; If they win  by exactly 7 points (the point spread), the result is a push or tie.&nbsp; That means that you don’t win or lose your  original bet is refunded.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        2.<strong>STRAIGHT  BETS</strong><br>
        Straight  bets are bets placed on a side, total or money line in Football, Basketball,  Baseball and Hockey or Prop.&nbsp; A straight  bet on a side usually involves a point-spread.&nbsp;  In this case you are wagering on a team to win the given time period on  which you wager (game, 1st, 2nd half) after the score is  adjusted by the particular point-spread.&nbsp;  When you wager on a total you are wagering that the score of the game  for the given time period (game, 1st, 2nd half) will be  over or under a designated number.&nbsp; In  either of these two bets you are laying 11 to 10 or some variance of those  odds, an example being bettors playing one side will lay 12 to win 10 and  bettors playing the other side will lay 10 to win 10.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When  wagering on game totals you are betting on the combined score of the game to go  over or under the designated number for the time period of your bet (1st  half, half time or full game).&nbsp; Total  wagers on the full game or 2nd half include overtime periods except  in the case of Soccer when three way betting is offered (the tie is offered as  a betting option).&nbsp; If the tie is offered  as an option overtime is not included in the calculation of game total.</p>
      <p>3.<strong>BUY  POINTS</strong><br>
        You  have the opportunity to buy points on straight bets and if bets in football and  basketball.&nbsp; You will typically pay more  to buy on and off of 3 and 7 in football.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>4.<strong>TOTALS  (OVER/UNDER)</strong><br>
        A  total wager is a bet on the number of points scored in the game by both teams  combined.&nbsp; You can bet on whether the  actual number of total points scored is over or under the line posted.&nbsp; The total points scored include points scored  in overtime.&nbsp; You can also bet whether  the combined number of points or goals scored by the two teams in the game will  be over or under the total set by the odds maker.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>For example, if the total is 32 and you  believe that the combined points scored by the two teams will exceed that  number, you would bet over 32. </p>
      <p>All straight and over/under bets players lay $11  for every $10 player wishes to win.&nbsp;  Unless otherwise specified.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>5.<strong>MONEY  LINES</strong><br>
        The  difference between a point spread bet and a money line bet is that there are no  points involved.&nbsp; Instead, money odds are  wagered on the favorite or underdog.&nbsp;  There is a different money line total for either side on a money line  bet, a negative side (the favorite) and a positive side (the underdog):&nbsp; Dallas - 170 Washington +150; What this means  is that Dallas is the favorite and for every $17 you bet on Dallas, you win $10  if they win.&nbsp; For every $10 you bet on  Washington, the underdog, you win $15 if they win.&nbsp; By offering different odds for each team the  sports book is able to balance action on both teams.</p>
      <p>6.<strong>RUN LINE</strong>&nbsp; <br>
        When  wagering on baseball you can select the run line as your wager option.&nbsp; A baseball run line is a combination of a  point spread and a money line.&nbsp; In a run  line you lay 1.5 runs on the favorite and also you either lay or get money depending  upon the degree of the favorite. The reverse is true for the underdog.&nbsp; You get 1.5 runs and again you either lay or  get money depending on the degree of the underdog.&nbsp; An example of a run line is:</p>
      <p align="center"> Braves .................. +1.5 -140<br>
        Dodgers ...............&nbsp; -1.5 +120</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p> In  this example you get 1.5 runs with the Braves but you must lay $140 to win  $100.&nbsp; If you choose the Dodgers you must  lay 1.5 runs but you get $120 for every $100 you lay.</p>
      <p>Note:&nbsp; <br>
        You cannot take a parlay between the run line and the  total of the same game.&nbsp; Run Lines are  always listed pitchers and the game must go must go 9 innings (8.5  if the home team is ahead) to have action. If a game is called or suspended in  extra innings, the score will be determined after the last full inning unless  the home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the  inning, in which case the score is determined at the time the game is called. </p>
      <p>7.<strong>PARLAYS</strong><br>
        ·&nbsp; A parlay is a wager in which you choose 2 or  more teams or totals together in one wager in order &nbsp;to receive a larger payout while risking a  smaller amount of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        ·&nbsp; You can mix and match different sports into  parlays, and even create parlays with the same  game (with some restrictions).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        ·&nbsp; Correlated parlays are not allowed.&nbsp; An example of this would be a parlay with the  1st half and&nbsp;the game spread of the same game or a run  line to a total in the same baseball game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        ·&nbsp; A loss on any part of the parlay constitutes  a loss.<br>
        ·&nbsp; In the case of a push and all other winners  the parlay reverts down one level.&nbsp; For  example, a 4-team parlay with one push and three winning plays would revert to  a 3-team parlay for purposes of payout.<br>
        ·&nbsp; In the case of a 2-team parlay with one push  and one winner the parlay will revert to a straight &nbsp;wager with  the amount of the parlay used as the “risk” amount.&nbsp; For example a 2-team parlay with both teams at the standard -110 would  pay out 91% of the parlay amount.&nbsp; <br>
        ·&nbsp; When a money line is used in the parlay it  has the potential to alter the payout amount in either direction depending on the line.</p>
      <p>8.<strong>ROUND  ROBINS</strong><br>
        Three (3) or  more teams selected to make up a series of parlays.&nbsp; A Round Robin is a series of parlay-type  wagers built from all possible groups of the specified round robin group size.&nbsp; The selections can be any combination of  sides, over/unders, money lines, run lines, or puck lines.</p>
      <p>9.<strong>TEASERS:  (FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL AND SIDES AND TOTALS ONLY)</strong><br>
        A  teaser, like a parlay, involves multiple propositions.&nbsp; When betting a teaser additional points are  either added to the underdog or subtracted from the favorite.&nbsp; Odds are changed in accordance to the number  of points the spread is moved and the number of teams combined to form the  teaser.</p>
      <p> The more games  you select in your teaser, the higher the odds increase and the bigger the  potential win if all of your selections are correct.</p>
      <p> For  example, Miami might be favored by 10 points in one game and Dallas might be a  5 point underdog in a second game. A 6 point teaser on the favorite would  adjust the Miami point spread 6 points in your favor so that Miami would now be  favored by 4 points (10-6=4). In the case of the underdog, a 6 point teaser  would increase the Dallas point spread 6 points in favor of Dallas so that they  would receive 11 points (5+6=11). </p>
      <p class="text">ON ANY SPECIAL TEASER A PUSH IS A LOSS</p>
      <p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>PLEASERS</strong><br>
        A  pleaser is a group of football side straight bets combined into one bet.&nbsp; The difference between a pleaser and a teaser  is that with a pleaser, the line you bet against for each individual wager is  moved against your favor 6 points.&nbsp; If  the regular line is -10 and you play a 6-point pleaser, then your line would be  -16.</p>
      <p> Pleaser  payoffs depend on how many teams are in your wager.</p>
      <p>If  a two-team pleaser has two ties, then the wager is a push. </p>
      <p>11.<strong>IF-BETS</strong><br>
        If  bets are a chain of conditional straight wagers based on two possible conditions:&nbsp; If win (single action) and if win, tie or  cancel (double action).&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In the first  case, single action, the bettor will have action on the next wager in the chain  only if the first one wins and so on down the chain.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In double action the player will have action  on the next bet and so on if the first bet wins, ties or cancels.</p>
      <p>Example  of Double Action:&nbsp; Braves +135 if win or  push then Dodgers -120</p>
      <p> Example  of Single Action:&nbsp; Braves +135 if win  only then Dodgers -120</p>
      <p> Should the Braves game get rained out on the double  action example it would continue to the Dodgers since that game is a push</p>
      <p> If  bets can contain 2 or more selections and cannot have any open spots.&nbsp; All parts of an individual if bet must be  placed at the same time and for the same amount or lower than the one before  it.&nbsp; All bets are graded on an individual  basis.&nbsp; This bet lets the player have  action on a multiple number of games with minimal risk.&nbsp; You are using the money you wagered on the  first game to wager on the second and so forth.&nbsp;  Each bet is graded independently so you do not have to win all  selections like a teaser or parlay.</p>
      <p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>12.<strong>REVERSE  BETS</strong><br>
        A  reverse is a series of IF bets going both forward and in “reverse” order.&nbsp; Each team included in the Reverse will pair  with another team to form two IF bets, one with that team first and another  with that team as the second team in the IF.</p>
      <p>Each  bet in the reverse is an individual straight wager for the full amount of the  reverse.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; <strong><em>Each bet is for the same amount.</em></strong></p>
      <p> A.&nbsp; <strong>WIN REVERSE:&nbsp; </strong>IF win only (single action).<br>
        B.&nbsp; <strong>ACTION REVERSE:</strong>&nbsp; IF win/tie/cancel (double action) condition.</p>
      <p><strong>WHY  USE THIS BET:</strong>&nbsp; A reverse offers the  advantage of a large payout without the risk of losing the bet if one team  loses.&nbsp; For example, if you place a  3-team reverse for $110 your total risk will be $660.&nbsp; If all 3 teams win you win $1200 and if only  2 teams win you still win $160.&nbsp; This  last example is under the assumption that all money lines were -110.</p>
      <p><strong>REVERSE  RULES:</strong><br>
        ·&nbsp; The Rules of  IF bets apply<br>
        ·&nbsp; The bet amount chosen for the Reverse is the  same amount for each IF bet in the reverse (you risk the same amount for each  IF bet created in the Reverse)<br>
        ·&nbsp; The maximum win is determined by adding up  the individual win amounts of each bet included&nbsp;in the reverse<br>
        ·&nbsp; Number of selections allowed 3<br>
        ·&nbsp; You may buy points on each selection in the  reverse up to a maximum of 2 points</p>
      <p>13.<strong>PROPS</strong><br>
        A proposition  bet is a bet offered with conditions and odds determined by an odds maker.&nbsp; These bets are usually exotic bets like which  quarterback will complete the most touchdown passes, which team will score the  last points in a game, or which will complete the longest field goal.&nbsp; Odds change daily and all wagers are  considered action at the odds quoted at the time of the wager. Due  to the variety of different proposition bets offered, the terms and conditions  are noted individually for each bet offer when making a bet. Like future bets,  all odds offered are to win only unless otherwise noted. </p>
      <p>14.<strong>FUTURES</strong><br>
        Futures are a  single wager on the outcome of an event that will be determined sometime in the  future.&nbsp; For example picking the winner  of the NFL championship, the Stanley Cup, or the World Series.&nbsp; These can include individual player  propositions and team propositions.</p>
      <p align="center">*<strong><em>Maximum pay back on all prop, exotic, and future bets is $10,000  (unless prior arrangements are made with agent)*</em></strong></p>
      <p align="center"><strong><em>*There are different limits on the various propositions and they can  only be played as a straight wager.&nbsp; No  parlays are allowed*</em></strong></p>

      <p><strong><a name="4" id="32"></a><span class="subtitle">REGULAR SEASON MLB</span></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Full Game Wagering:</strong></p>
      <p>When wagering on total runs (over/under) the game must  go 9 innings (8.5 if the home team is ahead) to have action.&nbsp; If a game is called or suspended in extra  innings, the score will be determined after the last full inning unless the  home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in  which case the score is determined at the time the game is called.</p>
      <p>Wagers on total runs will be refunded if a pitcher  change occurs prior to both listed pitchers throwing at least one pitch.</p>
      <p>Rules for Run Line and Team Total wagers are the same  as those for baseball totals</p>
      <p>The result of a game is official after 5 innings of  play unless the home team is leading after 4.5 innings.&nbsp; If a game is called or suspended, the winner  is determined by the score after the last full inning unless the home team  scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which  case the winner is determined by the score at the time the game is called.&nbsp; Monies will be refunded if the home team ties  the game and it is then suspended.&nbsp;  Suspended games will not carry over past 8:00am EST the following day  unless otherwise specified.</p>
      <p>We do not recognize postponed games, protests or  overturned decisions for wagering purposes.&nbsp;  All baseball wagers must go the day written, otherwise there is no  action and all monies are refunded.</p>
      <p> Money-line wagers on  baseball will be accepted in the following manner:</p>
      <p> *Action-team against team, regardless of the starting pitchers.</p>
      <p> *Listed Pitchers-if both starting pitchers are not exactly as specified  at the time of the bet, the wager will be deemed “no action”.</p>
      <p> *One Listed Pitcher-this is a wager on or against one specified  pitcher, regardless of the other starting pitcher.&nbsp; If the specified pitcher does not start, the  wager is deemed “no action”.</p>
      <p> (Examples: “The Braves versus Pettitte” indicates a wager against  Pettitte.&nbsp; “Pettitte against the &nbsp;Braves” indicates a wager on Pettitte)</p>
      <p> In the  event there is a pitching change prior to the game, the money-line will be  re-adjusted and&nbsp; “action”  wagers will be graded using the opening price for the new pitcher.</p>
      <p> A pitcher is deemed a  starter after throwing the first pitch to the opponent’s first batter.</p>
      <p> Wagers on totals, team  totals, and run-lines must always specify both pitchers listed.</p>
      <p> All games must go at least  8.5 innings if the home team is winning to have action on the Baseball&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand  Salami. </p>
      <p><strong>First-Half Wagers (5 Innings):</strong></p>
      <p>All wagers on baseball first halves (5 innings) will  be decided on the basis of the score at the end of five full innings</p>
      <p>If a game does not go five full innings, all  first-half wagers (5 innings) will be cancelled.</p>
      <p>Once 5 full innings have been completed, all wagers on  the first half (5 innings) will stand.</p>
      <p>All first-half wagers (5 innings) must list both  pitchers.&nbsp; If either listed pitcher does  not start, wagers on the first half (5 innings) will be cancelled</p>
      <p><strong>MLB Playoff Wagering:</strong></p>
      <p>These games have action regardless of start or  completion date.</p>
      <p>During the playoffs all wagers will be graded upon  completion of the game.&nbsp; For example,  should a game start and be suspended until a later date, all wagers will have  action and be graded upon completion of the game regardless of completion  date.&nbsp; Should this occur all wagers will  be graded on the completion date and not the starting date.</p>
      <p>First 5 innings will also be graded in the same manner  for MLB playoff baseball.&nbsp; They have  action regardless of start or completion date.&nbsp;  If there is a postponement then they will also be graded on the date the  1st 5 innings are completed.</p>
      <p>A pitcher is deemed started after throwing the first  pitch to the opponent’s first batter.</p>
      <p>Wagers on totals, team totals, and run-lines must  always specify both pitchers listed.</p>
      <p>Action, Listed and One Listed will have the same rules  as Regular Season Baseball.</p>
      <p><strong>Live Wagering:</strong></p>
      <p>Live wagering must go at least 9 innings (8.5 if home team is winning)  to have action for all wagers including spread, total and money-line.</p>
      <p>Live score wagers are for the score of the complete game.&nbsp; The lines take into account the current score  of the game and are adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>NCAA and NCAA Softball:</strong></p>
      <p>These games have action regardless of their starting  or completion date.</p>
      <p>Any baseball or softball game ending as a result of  the mercy rule will have action on all wagers unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <p>Bottom team listed does not necessarily bat last.</p>
      <p><strong>Baseball Props:</strong></p>
      <p>All Player and Game Prop wagers are listed  pitchers.&nbsp; Wagers placed “listed” listing  a pitcher who does not start will NOT have action and all money will be  refunded.</p>
      <p>For individual Player Props a Player must start the  game to have action.&nbsp; If player does not  start game wagers are cancelled and money will be refunded.</p>
      <p>Player Props:&nbsp;  Follow the same rules as Total Runs and Run Line wagers to have action.</p>
      <p>Contest Props (those containing 3 or more contestants)  are NOT listed pitchers and ALL PLAYERS ARE ACTION.</p>
      <p>1st inning props are graded after the 1st  inning.</p>
      <p>1st RBI and 1st Run Contest  Props:&nbsp; These will be graded when the 1st  RBI and 1st Run is recorded.</p>
      <p>1st Home Run Prop:&nbsp; Must go at least 8.5 innings if the home team  is winning.</p>
      <p>MLB Regular Season Series:&nbsp; Regular season series wagers are for the  first 3 games of the series regardless of dates and have action as long as a  minimum of two games are completed and neither team plays another opponent  between games.&nbsp; If less than 3 games are  played, the team with the advantage is the winner of the series.&nbsp; For games to count towards the series they  must be official in the MLB standings for action.</p>

      <p> We accept single-match bets on every match we offer.</p>
      <p>Soccer kickoff dates and times displayed on our  website are an indication only and are not guaranteed to be correct.&nbsp; Bet offers are often posted before exact  kickoff dates and times are set by league administrators.&nbsp; As matches draw near, our displayed times  will become more accurate.&nbsp; When kickoff  dates or times change slightly for any reason wagers will continue to be  valid.&nbsp; If prior to the match starting, a  match is cancelled and rescheduled more than 48 hours into the future, wagers  will be considered void and all wagers will be refunded.&nbsp; In case of inclement weather or other  disruption, wagers will remain “pending” for 48 hours.&nbsp; If it is unclear as to whether bets should  stand or be refunded because of a postponement, we will follow the consensus  rulings of bookmakers in Asia and in Europe.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified, wagers on the outcome of a  match will be decided on regulation time only.&nbsp;  This includes two halves of play and any time the referee adds on to  compensate for injuries and other stoppages and will be referred to at times as  “Full Time”.&nbsp; It does not include periods  of extra time nor penalty shootouts.</p>
      <p>After a match has started, should a match be suspended  before full time is reached, and not completed the same day, wagers on the  outcome of the match are considered void and all wagers shall be returned.</p>
      <p>Over/Under:&nbsp; A  match must reach full time for wagers on the total number of goals scored in  the match to be valid.&nbsp; Extra time and  penalty shootouts do not count.</p>
      <p>Should there be a dispute over a proposition (examples  include, but are not limited to: name of the first goal scorer; time of a goal)  wagers will be settled and paid based on the reports of the sporting media</p>
      <p>3 way line wagering: When the “Draw” option is offered  for a soccer game then there will be no pushes for the money line.&nbsp; For Example, if the 3 way line is the following: </p>
      <p>Mexico + 175<br>
        USA + 150<br>
        Draw + 200</p>
      <p>If you wager on USA, USA must win the game in full time (both halves +  injury time) for you to win the wager.&nbsp;  If USA and Mexico are tied after full time, then the Draw is the winner  and any wagers on Mexico and USA will be scored as a loss.</p>
      <p> Wagers on a team to ‘Raise the Cup’ or to ‘Advance’ or  any other term implying that the team will win the match will be graded based  on the final outcome of the game including all overtime and penalty shootouts.</p>
      <p>In the case of a shootout the team winning the  shootout will be awarded one goal towards any wager (side, total, etc.) in  which shootout time is included.</p>
      <p>For player props to have action the game must go the  full time.</p>
      <p>All Soccer Props will be graded at the end of full  time (both halves + injury time).&nbsp;  Overtime and shoot-outs do not count for props unless otherwise  specified. For player props, players must start the game to have action.</p>
      <p>2nd half wagers are only for the 2nd  half.&nbsp; Overtime and shoot-outs are not  included in 2nd half wagers.</p>

      <p align="left"><span class="text"><strong><br>
        </strong></span></p>
      <p> When the bell sounds to begin the first round, the  bout will be considered official for betting purposes, regardless of the  scheduled length or title.</p>
      <p>If the scheduled length of the match is changed, all  prior wagers on the number of rounds the bout will last will be graded as ‘No  Action’.</p>
      <p>Each round is three minutes in duration; a half-round  is defined as ninety seconds.&nbsp; For  example if the over/under for a fight is 7.5 rounds, the fight must go 1:31  into the 8th round for the over to be a winner.&nbsp; That is 7 full rounds and .5 of the 8th.</p>
      <p>For wagering purposes, the disqualification of a boxer  during a match will be counted as a knockout by his opponent.</p>
      <p>A wager on a fighter to win “Inside Distance” wins if  the fighter wins by knockout, technical knockout, disqualification, or  technical decision.</p>
      <p>If the wagering offer on a match includes the draw as  a third option and the match ends in a draw, wagers on the draw will be paid,  while wagers on either fighter will be lost.&nbsp;  If the wagering offer includes only the two boxers, with the draw either  not offered or offered as a separate proposition, and the match ends in a draw,  wagers on either fighter will be refunded.</p>
      <p>In situations not covered by the previous rules, the  wagering decision announced by the Don Best Sports information service will be  considered official and binding.</p>
      <p>If a fight is scheduled for 12 rounds and after the 3rd  round ends but before the 4th round begins, Mayweather fails to  answer the bell to start the 4th round.&nbsp; Mayweather’s opponent will be graded as a  winner in the 3rd round.&nbsp; A  round is not complete until the fighters start the following round.&nbsp; One exception to this rule is the last round  of a fight.</p>
      <p>A win by decision is not a win in the final round of  the fight.&nbsp; For example if round 12 ends  and then Mayweather wins by a decision, Mayweather to win in round 12 will be a  loser since round 12 ended and Mayweather won by decision.&nbsp; The same rule is applied to win in multiple  rounds.&nbsp; For example Mayweather to win in  round 10-12, 6-12, etc…</p>
      <p>Las Vegas wagering rules will be used for any  situation not covered herein.</p>

        </strong></span></p>
      <p> A wager for a fighter to win by KO/TKO wins only by a  knock out, technical knockout, or corner stoppage.&nbsp; A win by submission is not considered a win  by KO/TKO in MMA.</p>
      <p>For wagering purposes, a disqualification of a fighter  will be counted as a knockout by his opponent.</p>
      <p>If a fight is scheduled for 5 rounds and after the 3rd  round ends but before the 4th round begins, Gracie fails to answer  the bell to start the 4th round.&nbsp;  Gracie’s opponent will be graded as a winner in the 3rd  round.&nbsp; A round is not complete until the  fighters start the following round.&nbsp; One  exception to this rule is the last round of a fight.</p>
      <p>A win by decision is not a win in the final  round.&nbsp; For example if round 5 ends of a  scheduled 5 round fight and Gracie wins by a decision, Gracie to win in round 5  will be a loser since round 5 ended and Gracie won by a decision.</p>
      <p>A wager on a fighter to win “Inside Distance” wins if  the fighter wins by knockout, technical knockout, disqualification, submission  or technical decision.</p>

        </span><strong>Postponements: </strong>If a race or  qualifier is postponed for any reason, all wagers will remain valid for 48  hours.&nbsp; If the postponement lasts more  than 48 hours, all wagers will be cancelled and the monies refunded.</p>
      <p> <strong>NASCAR Races:</strong></p>
      <p> The Official NASCAR winner of the race shall be the  winner of the race for wagering purposes; this includes all races which are  halted prematurely for any reason.</p>
      <p>In head-to-head matchups, both drivers must start the  race in order for the wager to be considered “action”.</p>
      <p>If a starting driver who has completed at least one  lap is replaced during the race by another driver for any reason, the starting  driver will be awarded the finishing driver’s position at the end of the race.</p>
      <p> Example: Driver Earnhardt starts the race, completes 8 laps, but leaves  the race due to injury, and then replacement driver Smith finishes the race and  places 10th.&nbsp; In the race  standings, driver Earnhardt would be credited with a 10th place  finish.</p>
      <p> <strong>Futures (Ante post) Betting: </strong>All futures (Ante post) bets have action.&nbsp; Should a driver withdraw before a race  begins, bets on that driver to win the race lose.</p>
      <p> <strong>NASCAR Qualifiers:</strong></p>
      <p> For qualifying matchups, only the times posted during  the qualifying session are used.</p>
      <p>If a driver starts a lap but does not post a time, the  driver is deemed to finish last, losing to all drivers who post a time.&nbsp; If more than one driver starts a lap but does  not post a time, all such drivers are tied.</p>
      <p>If a driver does not cross the start line, all wagers that  specify that driver are considered “no action”.</p>
      <p>Disqualifications that occur more than 30 minutes  after the qualifying session has ended are not recognized for wagering  purposes.</p>

        <strong>Match Betting: </strong>&nbsp;Two full sets must be completed  for wagers to stand.&nbsp; If less than two  sets are completed, all wagers will be graded as NO ACTION and the money will  be refunded.</p>
      <p><strong>Set Betting:&nbsp; </strong>If a player retires or is disqualified at any point  during a match Set Betting wagers are void.&nbsp;  If the match is shortened for any reason and a winner declared then all  bets will be cancelled and the money will be refunded.</p>
      <p><strong>Game Betting:&nbsp; </strong>If a player retires or is disqualified at any point  during a match Game Betting wagers are void.&nbsp;  If the match is shortened for any reason and a winner declared then all  bets will be cancelled and the money will be refunded.</p>

      <p>In the event a match does not go the specified number  of sets, and the match is shortened by tournament officials, the leader determined  to be official by tournament officials shall be the winner.<br>

      <p><span class="subtitle">Golf:</span><br>
        <br>
        If the start of a round is delayed, or if play during  a round is suspended, all pending wagers will remain valid for 48 hours.&nbsp; If the postponement lasts more than 48 hours,  all wagers will be cancelled and the monies refunded.</p>
      <p>In the event a tournament does not go the specified  number of completed holes (usually 72), and the tournament is shortened by  tournament officials, the leader at the end of the number of holes determined  to be official by tournament officials shall be the winner.</p>
      <p>Example:&nbsp; A tournament is  scheduled for 72 holes, but only 54 holes can be played because of  weather.&nbsp; The leader at the end of 54  holes would be declared the winner of the tournament.</p>
      <p> In the event that two (or more) golfers are tied for the lead at the  end of regulation play, a sudden death playoff is normally used to determine  the winner of the tournament.&nbsp; In this  case, the winner of the playoff is the winner for betting purposes.&nbsp; All other golfers in the playoff will graded  as 2nd place finishers.</p>
      <p> Example:&nbsp; Woods and Mcilroy are  tied at the end of regulation play, and a sudden death playoff is declared.&nbsp; Woods scores a 4 on the first playoff hole,  and Mcilroy scores a 5.&nbsp; Woods is the  winner of the tournament, and Mcilroy is awarded a 2nd place finish.<br>
        In some tournaments, tournament officials may have the individuals play  a specified number of holes to determine the tournament winner.&nbsp; In this case, the golfer with the lowest  score after the specified number of holes has been completed shall be declared  the winner, and all other golfers in the playoff will be graded as 2nd  place finishers.</p>
      <p><strong>Golf Match-ups:</strong><br>
        In head to head match-ups, both golfers must tee off in order to have  action.&nbsp; If both players tee off, the  golfer with the most completed holes is the winner of the match-up; If both  players complete the same number of holes, the one with the lower score is the  winner.</p>
      <p> Example:&nbsp; Match-up money-line:<br>
        Woods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -120<br>
        Mcilroy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + 100</p>
      <p> If Woods and Mcilroy both tee off for the tournament in question, the  above match-up is “in action”.&nbsp; If both  golfers fail to make the cut to advance to the final rounds of play, the golfer  with the lower score wins.<br>
        Suppose Woods completed 36 holes with a score of +8; Mcilroy completes  36 holes with a score of +9.&nbsp; In this  case Woods wins the match-up since he has a lower score than Mcilroy does.</p>
      <p> If Woods and Mcilroy complete regulation play, and each has a score of  -3, the match-up would be a tie, and monies refunded, except in the case where  Woods and Mcilroy were tied for 1st place at the end of regulation  play (in which case a sudden death playoff would be used to determine the  winner).</p>
      <p> <strong>Golf Spreads:&nbsp; </strong>A player will automatically cover the spread if they  make the cut and the other player in the matchup does not.&nbsp; For example, if Woods makes the cut and  Mcilroy does not, then Woods will automatically cover the spread regardless of  how many strokes Woods made the cut by.&nbsp;  Also if a player completes more holes than another player for any reason  they will automatically win the spread.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> For example if Mcilroy withdraws at any point of the tournament and  Woods completes more holes than Mcilroy, Woods again will automatically beat  Mcilroy on the spread regardless of score.&nbsp;  Should a playoff ensue between two players that are involved in a  matchup the winner will be graded as a winner by 1 stroke regardless of the  playoff scores.&nbsp; For individual round  spreads the same rules apply as above.</p>
      <p> Example:&nbsp; Match-up spread:<br>
        Woods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -1.5<br>
        Mcilroy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +1.5</p>
      <p> In the above example Woods must score at least 2 strokes better than  Mcilroy to cover the spread.</p>
      <p> <strong>Golf Totals:&nbsp; </strong>Individual player round totals the player must  complete the round for action.&nbsp; If a  player withdraws or does not complete the round due to any reason then the  total will be cancelled and all monies refunded.&nbsp; For the winners score prop it must go  scheduled tournament length for action.&nbsp;  For most tournaments this is 72 holes and it will be graded with the 72  hole score.&nbsp; Playoffs are not included in  the winning score prop.&nbsp; If a tournament  is shorted then this prop will be cancelled and money refunded.</p>
      <p><strong>Cut:&nbsp; </strong>For any props involving the cut, the cut will be the  highest score of the golfers that continue to play the next round.&nbsp; For example: Woods has a score of 140 and  Mcilroy has a score of 141.&nbsp; Woods makes  the cut and continues while Mcilroy misses the cut.&nbsp; The cut prop will be graded as 150 since this  is the highest score of the player than continues to play in the tournament.</p>
      <p><strong>Make/Miss the Cut:&nbsp; </strong>If a player withdraws before the cut has been made  then he will be graded as missing the cut.&nbsp;  If a player makes the cut and then withdraws after the cut has been made  he will be graded as making the cut.</p>
      <p><strong>Politics:</strong><br>
        All wagers and prop bets that become public knowledge  will have NO ACTION, if wagered on following the information becoming public.</p>
      <p>Events will be graded the following day at 10am EST.&nbsp; This is assuming that newyorktimes.com has  declared a winner in the election.&nbsp; If  newyorktimes.com has NOT declared a winner, then we will use the results from  the next day at 10am EST, and keep going day-to-day until an official  newyorktimes.com projection has been made.</p>
      <p>It is irrelevant what % of the actual votes have been  counted as long as newyorktimes.com has declared a winner.</p>
      <p>Once a wager has been graded, it will not be  overturned due to events that happen in the futures.&nbsp; For example, all absentee ballots and  recounts will not be counted assuming newyorktimes.com has declared an official  winner as of 10am EST the following day.</p>
      <p>For all spreads, over/under, finishing positions and  other prop bets on political elections we will also use those newyorktimes.com  results based on if they have declared an official winner.&nbsp; If there is a dispute between 3rd  and 4th place, as long as a winner has been declared it is  irrelevant and we will use the vote count used by newyorktimes.com at 10am EST  the following day.</p>
      <p>For all spreads and over/under, the decimal places  will be used for grading purposes.&nbsp; For  example, if the spread is -3 and the candidate wins by 3.2%, then -3 is a  winner and +3 is a loser.&nbsp; For an example  for over/under if the total is 25, and the final is 25.2%, then over is a  winner and under is a loser.</p>
      <p>If newyorktimes.com does not have information  available for a particular election, we will use the local election board if  official results are available.&nbsp; This  will be looked at 10am EST the following day assuming 90% of the votes have  been counted.&nbsp; The next day at 10am EST  if newyorktimes.com still does not have the results and the local election  results are unavailable with 90% of the votes counted it will continue to go  day to day until either one of those have the information.</p>
      <p> If there is a prop wager on a candidate to declare to  run for office, they must officially declare for said office.&nbsp; Exploratory committees do not count, and is a  separate prop wager.</p>
      <p>If there is a prop wager on a candidate to drop out of  the race, the candidate will be considered dropped out when they have made any  similar type announcement and they are no longer actively campaigning for  votes.</p>
