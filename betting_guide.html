    <h2>Straight</h2>
  <p>A straight bet is a single wager on the outcome of a single event or game. Depending on the line-type, the outright winner, the spread or a combined total of both teams decide whether you win or lose. The confirmed price at the time you placed your wager, will determine the amount you win, with certain exceptions.</p>
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>All straight bets are single wagers which outcome is Win, Loss or Push (Tie, No Action, and/or Cancelled) based on the event or game wagered on.</li>
    <li>All have standard odds (-110) and pay 10/11 unless otherwise noted. </li>
    <li>The line taken when the wager is placed will remain regardless of subsequent line fluctuation on Wagershack.NET lines, except on Baseball Money Lines Straight Wagers (please review Baseball regulations).</li>
    <li>Ties, Cancellations, Pushes and No Action wagers, for whatever reasons they occur, will result in wager amounts being returned to the client’s account. </li>
    <li>Each Prop wager has different set of rules so please contact us if you don't understand those regulations.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>If Bets</h2>
  <p>An if bet consists of two (2) to five (5) straight bets joined together by an if clause which determines the wager process. If the player’s first selection complies with the condition (clause), then the second selection will have action; if the second selection complies with the condition, then customer’s third selection will have action and so on. </p>
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Any sport can be included in an If Bet. </li>
    <li>A minimum of two selections and a maximum of five selections can be used in an IF Bet </li>
    <li>Circled games, futures and props cannot be included in an IF Bet. </li>
    <li>If Bets must be placed prior to the earliest event on the Ticket </li>
    <li>All risk amounts must be equal or less than the previous selection.</li>
    <li>In single action (win only), subsequent selection will only have action if the preceding wager is a win. </li>
    <li>In double action (win and push), subsequent bets will have action only if the preceding bet is a win, push, no action, or cancelled. </li>
    <li>Related combinations within the same game or associated periods are not allowed. </li>
    <li><b>Buying points is allowed</b></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Action Reverse</h2>
  <p>A Reverse consist of a selection that goes from two (2) to five (5) straight bets joined together into all possible combinations of two team If Bets Double Action. Same rules for If Bets will apply.</p>
  <h3>Buying Points</h3>
  <p>Buying points allows changing the point-spread or total of a football or basketball game. Buying points allows the customer to move the point spread to his/her advantage; therefore customer will get more points when betting the underdog or will give away fewer points when betting the favorite. Customer will be also allowed to move the total in order to get a higher total when betting the under or a lower total if betting the over. For each half point the customer purchases, will have to pay an extra 10%.</p>
  <p>Customer can only buy a maximum of 2 points in Football and Basketball, both college and pro with certain exceptions.</p>
  <p>There are two special rules:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>When buying on or off the number 3 for all Football, there is a premium cost of 25%, not 10%. So for example to move the Colts from -3 -110 to -2.5, the new line will be -2.5 -135 (lay $135 to win $100). The same is true for the underdog, to buy Bears from +3 -110 to +3.5 will be -135 (lay $135 to win $110). </li>
    <li>When buying on or off the number 7 for all Football, the premium is 20%.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Parlay Wagers</h2>
  <p>A parlay is a type of cumulative bet where the customer can choose from two up to fifteen teams and the payout will increase as selections get higher. In order to win the wager all of the selections must be winners. Even if only one of the selections loses, the entire play will become a loss. The benefit of Parlay wager is that the more selections made the bigger payout will be.</p>
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>You may combine any point spread, money line and/or totals  from any sport/event open for parlays.</li>
    <li>If any selection of a parlay is a loss, the entire parlay will be considered a loss. </li>
    <li>If any selection of a parlay is a Push, Cancellation, Tie, or if any of the events are graded as No Action, the parlay will revert to the lower amount of teams, and so the payout will change. In a case of a two team parlay, it will revert to a straight wager in which the risk amount will remain but the payout will change.</li>
    <li>Related combinations within the same game or associated periods are not allowed. </li>
    <li>Regardless of any sport or line the maximum parlay payout is $100,000 </li>
  </ol>
  <p>All parlay payouts are calculated at true odds. The exception is where all selections are priced at -110. In this case the payout odds below apply.</p>
  <p>Parlay Payout Table for Standard -110 Parlays</p>
  <table class="t1" style="width: 60%">

      <tr>
        <td>2 team</td>
        <td>13 to 5</td>

  <p>Customer may estimate Parlay Payoffs when the price is different than -110 by following this steps (example provided):</p>
  <p>Let's say you played Cubs +150 and Cubs game over 9 -120 in a two team parlay and you wagered $100. Use the following steps to determine your winnings or should we say potential winnings.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Calculate Parlay Factor for each team: if the price of the team is positive + simply add one to get factor, if the price of the piece is negative - calculate reciprocal, multiply by -1, and then add one.</li>
    <p>1.50 + 1 = 2.50</p>
    <p>-1.20 (take reciprocal or divide one by the negative price) 1/1.20 = 0.83 + 1 = 1.83</p>
    <li>Multiply all factors, then multiply this factor times the bet amount and the result is the payout (including your bet)</li>
    <p>2.50 x 1.83 = 4.57 (now multiply this times your bet) x 100 = 457</p>
    <p>$457 is your total return if both pieces win (including your bet amount)</p>
    <li>Subtract from previous result the amount wagered, and this last step will give an estimated payout amount of the play.</li>
    <p>457 - 100 = 357 Winnings</p>
  </ol>
  <p>This will also work for three, four, five, six... team parlays, simply follow the steps. Note: This will provide an estimated amount; actual winnings may differ due to rounding rule.</p>
  <h2>Round Robin</h2>
  <p>A Round Robin is a wager type consisting of all parlay combinations of a chosen number within a group of selected teams (2 team parlay maximum). This type of wager gives the customer the advantage of placing multiple parlays within a chosen set of teams.</p>
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Standard parlay rules will apply.</li>
    <li>A Round Robin will involve between three and fifteen selections.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Teasing Wagers</h2>
  <p>A teaser is a wager involving two or more outcomes in a single wager wherein you adjust the point spread/total in your favor in return of reduced odds.</p>
  <p>A teaser can only be played in American Football (NFL/NCAA) and Basketball (NBA/NCAA) or a combination of these two sports only. Teasers have a minimum of two selections and a maximum of seven.</p>
  <p>You can tease the point spread and or total on a basketball or football game. When you tease the favorite on the point spread you are actually decreasing the number of points that your selection has in order to win by, or if you take the underdog you are increasing the points your selection can lose the game by before the selection is a loss. When your teaser includes overs and/or unders, the total is teased lower if you choose an over and higher if you choose and under.</p>
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Teasers must have between 2 and 6 teams</li>
    <li>Any loss in a teaser will grade the entire wager as a loss. There are no partial payouts. </li>
    <li>A push in a regular teaser is a loss. </li>
    <li>Any event which does not take place on the date specified in the wager will be graded as No Action and the wager will reduce accordingly as explained above. </li>
    <li>Any number of totals is possible.</li>
    <li>No open spots allowed.</li>
